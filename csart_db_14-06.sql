He is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia and Co-Director, Health and Policy, of the Brain & Mind Centre (BMC), University of Sydney. From 2012 to 2018, he was a Commissioner of the Australian National Mental Health Commission (NMHC), with a major focus on improving outcome measurement and improved accountability for Australia’s investments in mental health services. In partnership with the Mental Health Council of Australia, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, Orygen Youth Health, the Young & Well CRC and the National Mental Health Commission, he has authored major national reports on community experiences of mental health services. Prof Hickie was a key participant in the most recent 2014 NMHC review of Mental Health Programmes and Services, which served as the template for the 2015 Turnbull Government initiatives in Mental Health Reform (total value $190M), including specifically the $30M Project Synergy investment in new technologies and the new $90M investment in 12 large regional trials of suicide prevention. His long-standing commitment to the impact of mental health research on mental health service improvement, through active engagement with those with lived experiences (patients, families and communities) in Australia is evident in his: i) capacity to facilitate public engagement with mental health issues, notably through his initial CEO role with beyondblue (2000-03); ii) engagement with major national mental health service reports over two decades (notably 2006, Not For Service Report with Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission); iii) continuous public commentary on contemporary mental health and suicide prevention issues; and iv) role in implementation of substantive health services reform in Australia (e.g. headspace and Young&Well CRC and now Project Synergy). He has been recognised nationally for his role over the last two decades in using clinical, health services and population health data to drive enhanced primary care services, increased access to psychological treatments and better interventions for those with severe mood disorders. In partnership with Prof Pat McGorry, he has been at the forefront of development and systematic evaluation of the new primary care based national youth mental health services (headspace). He has been a critical voice in the advocacy for enhanced social and health services for those with persistent mental illness and increased accountability for delivery of those services.'),(47,'Danya Rose',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(48,'Daniel Rock',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(49,'Yun Ju Christine Song',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(50,'Sebastian Rosenberg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(51,'Louise Freebairn',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(52,'Catherine Vacher',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(58,'Andrew Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(59,'Geoff McDonnell',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(60,'Mark Heffernan',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(61,'Bill Campos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(62,'Graham Meadows',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(63,'Dylan Knowles',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(64,'John Wiggers',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(65,'Michael Livingston',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(66,'Robin Room',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(67,'Eloise O\'Donnell',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(68,'Sandra Jones',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(69,'Paul S Haber',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(70,'David Muscatello',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(71,'Nadine Ezard',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(72,'Nghi Phung',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(73,'Devon Indig',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(74,'Lucie Rychetnik',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(75,'Jaithri Ananthapavan',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(76,'Sonia Wutzke',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(77,'Jan Scott',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(78,'Kirill Glavatsky',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(108,'Nicholas Ho',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(109,'Jo Robinson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(110,'Grace Yeeun Lee',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(111,'Christopher J Nolan',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(112,'Paul M Kelly',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(113,'Yang Qin',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(114,'Weicheng Qian',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(115,'Anahita Safarishahrbijari',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,'Luke Penza',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(117,'Allen McLean',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(118,'Alison L Kent',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(119,'Roland Dyck',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(120,'Louise Maple-Brown',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(121,'Vincy Li',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(122,'Nick Roberts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(123,'Thomas Lung',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(124,'Suzanne Nieuwenhuizen',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(125,'Bev Lloyd',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(126,'Jo Mitchell',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(127,'Lennert Veerman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(128,'Margaret Bright',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(129,'Pippy Walker',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(130,'Rebecca Whitehead',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(131,'Suzan Burton',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(132,'Tim Roselli',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(133,'David P Thomas',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(134,'Mark West',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(136,'Ellie Fossey',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(137,'Sarah Francis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(138,'Frances Shawyer',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(139,'Ritsuko Kakuma',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(140,'Scott Patten',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(141,'Joanne Enticott',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(142,'Kurt Kreuger',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(143,'Cathy Watson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(144,'Zongjian Yang',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(145,'Michael Rudd',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(146,'Kryss McKenna',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(147,'Adrian Barnett',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(148,'David McGrath',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(149,'Mark Sinyor',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(150,'Phillip Cheuk Fung Law',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(151,'Rifat Zahan',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(152,'Benedikt Till',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(153,'Madelyn Gould',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(154,'Jane Pirkis',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(155,'Katrina Witt',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(156,'Lay San Too',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(157,'Nicole T.

The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to effectively respond.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThis study aimed to explore the impact of strengthening the mental health system through technology-enabled care coordination on mental health and suicide outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nA system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behavior. The model reproduced historic time series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental health–related emergency department (ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030. These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care coordination. Each scenario was tested using both pre– and post–COVID-19 social and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nTechnology-enabled care coordination was forecast to deliver a reduction in self-harm hospitalizations and suicide deaths by 6.71% (95% interval 5.63%-7.87%), mental health–related ED presentations by 10.33% (95% interval 8.58%-12.19%), and the prevalence of high psychological distress by 1.76 percentage points (95% interval 1.35-2.32 percentage points). Scenario testing demonstrated that increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth had substantially lower impacts. This pattern of results was replicated under post–COVID-19 conditions with technology-enabled care coordination being the only tested scenario, which was forecast to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on mental health and suicide.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nThe use of technology-enabled care coordination is likely to improve mental health and suicide outcomes. The substantially lower effectiveness of targeting individual components of the mental health system (ie, increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth) reiterates that strengthening the whole system has the greatest impact on patient outcomes. Investments into more of the same types of programs and services alone will not be enough to improve outcomes; instead, new models of care and the digital infrastructure to support them and their integration are needed.',NULL,NULL,'2021-06-30',NULL,NULL,NULL),(43,'System Dynamics Modeling of Humanitarian Relief Operations','https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1139817#','Against the backdrop of over two hundred thousand people dead or missing and millions of people homeless after China\'s massive earthquake and Myanmar devastating cyclone, forecasts estimate that natural and man-made disasters are likely to increase five-fold both in number and impact over the next 50 years. Hence, the need for disaster relief provided by humanitarian organizations during disasters should continue to increase. At the same time, humanitarian organizations face increased challenges scaling capacity, improving operational efficiency, reducing staff turnover, improving institutional learning, satisfying increasingly demanding donors, and operating in increasingly challenging environments, with poor or inexistent infrastructure, high demand uncertainty and little time to prepare and respond. To address such challenges, managers in humanitarian organizations must understand the complexity that characterizes humanitarian relief efforts to learn how to design and manage complex relief operations. Yet, learning in such complex and ever changing environments is difficult precisely because managers seldom confront many of the consequences of their most important decisions. Effective learning in such environments requires methods and tools that allow managers to capture important feedback processes, accumulations, delays, and nonlinear relationships, visualizing complex systems in terms of the structures and policies that create dynamics and regulate performance. The system dynamics approach provides managers with a set of tools that can help them learn in complex environments. These tools include causal mapping, which enables managers to think systemically and to represent the dynamic complexity in a system of interest, and simulation modeling, which permits managers to assess the consequences of interactions among variables, experience the long-term side effects of decisions, systematically explore new strategies, and develop understanding of complex systems',NULL,NULL,'2008-06-02',NULL,NULL,NULL),(68,'Sound Decision Making in Uncertain Times: Can Systems Modelling Be Useful for Informing Policy and Planning for Suicide Prevention?','https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1468','The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the significant value of systems modelling in supporting proactive and effective public health decision making despite the complexities and uncertainties that characterise an evolving crisis. The same approach is possible in the field of mental health. However, a commonly levelled (but misguided) criticism prevents systems modelling from being more routinely adopted, namely, that the presence of uncertainty around key model input parameters renders a model useless. This study explored whether radically different simulated trajectories of suicide would result in different advice to decision makers regarding the optimal strategy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. Using an existing system dynamics model developed in August 2020 for a regional catchment of Western Australia, four scenarios were simulated to model the possible effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of psychological distress. The scenarios produced a range of projected impacts on suicide deaths, ranging from a relatively small to a dramatic increase. Discordance in the sets of best-performing intervention scenarios across the divergent COVID-mental health trajectories was assessed by comparing differences in projected numbers of suicides between the baseline scenario and each of 286 possible intervention scenarios calculated for two time horizons; 2026 and 2041. The best performing intervention combinations over the period 2021–2041 (i.e., post-suicide attempt assertive aftercare, community support programs to increase community connectedness, and technology enabled care coordination) were highly consistent across all four COVID-19 mental health trajectories, reducing suicide deaths by between 23.9–24.6% against the baseline. However, the ranking of best performing intervention combinations does alter depending on the time horizon under consideration due to non-linear intervention impacts. These findings suggest that systems models can retain value in informing robust decision making despite uncertainty in the trajectories of population mental health outcomes. It is recommended that the time horizon under consideration be sufficiently long to capture the full effects of interventions, and efforts should be made to achieve more timely tracking and access to key population mental health indicators to inform model refinements over time and reduce uncertainty in mental health policy and planning decisions.',NULL,NULL,'2022-01-27',NULL,NULL,NULL),(71,'Systems modelling tools to support policy and planning','https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30302-7','In their Viewpoint, Harry Rutter and colleagues (Dec 9, 2017, p 2602)1 make another welcomed call for increased uptake and investment in systems modelling tools to provide evidence better suited to addressing complex public health problems.

This study investigates the potential impacts of service capacity improvements on the incidence of suicidal behaviour in the Australian context.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nA system dynamics model was developed to investigate the optimal combination of (1) secondary (acute) mental health service capacity, (2) non-secondary (non-acute) mental health service capacity and (3) resources to re-engage those lost to services on the incidence of suicidal behaviour over the period 2018–2028 for the Greater Western Sydney (Australia) population catchment. The model captured population and behavioural dynamics and mental health service referral pathways and was validated using population survey and administrative data, evidence syntheses and an expert stakeholder group.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nFindings suggest that 28% of attempted suicide and 29% of suicides could be averted over the forecast period based on a combination of increases in (1) hospital staffing (with training in trauma-informed care), (2) non-secondary health service capacity, (3) expansion of mental health assessment capacity and (4) re-engagement of at least 45% of individuals lost to services. Reduction in the number of available psychiatric beds by 15% had no substantial impact on the incidence of attempted suicide and suicide over the forecast period.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThis study suggests that more than one-quarter of suicides and attempted suicides in the Greater Western Sydney population catchment could potentially be averted with a combination of increases to hospital staffing and non-secondary (non-acute) mental health care.

As the trajectory of the pandemic and the economic recovery are still uncertain, decision tools are needed to help evaluate the best interventions to improve mental health outcomes. We developed a system dynamics model that captures causal relationships among population, demographics, post-secondary education, health services, COVID-19 impact, and mental health outcomes. The study was conducted in the Australian state of Victoria. The model was calibrated using historical data and was stratified by age group and by geographic remoteness. Findings demonstrate that the most effective intervention combination includes economic, social, and health sector initiatives. Assertive post-suicide attempt care is the most impactful health sector intervention, but delaying implementation reduces the potency of its impact.

Strategies to manage and prevent this condition are contested. Dynamic simulation models (DSM) can test policy and program scenarios before implementation in the real world. This paper reports the development and use of an advanced DSM exploring the impact of maternal weight status interventions on incidence of HIP.\r\n\r\nMethods A consortium of experts collaboratively developed a hybrid DSM of HIP, comprising system dynamics, agent-based and discrete event model components. The structure and parameterization drew on a range of evidence and data sources. Scenarios comparing population-level and targeted prevention interventions were simulated from 2018 to identify the intervention combination that would deliver the greatest impact.\r\n\r\nResults Population interventions promoting weight loss in early adulthood were found to be effective, reducing the population incidence of HIP by 17.3% by 2030 (baseline (‘business as usual’ scenario)=16.1%, 95% CI 15.8 to 16.4; population intervention=13.3%, 95% CI 13.0 to 13.6), more than targeted prepregnancy (5.2% reduction; incidence=15.3%, 95% CI 15.0 to 15.6) and interpregnancy (4.2% reduction; incidence=15.5%, 95% CI 15.2 to 15.8) interventions. Combining targeted interventions for high-risk groups with population interventions promoting healthy weight was most effective in reducing HIP incidence (28.8% reduction by 2030; incidence=11.5, 95% CI 11.2 to 11.8). Scenarios exploring the effect of childhood weight status on entry to adulthood demonstrated significant impact in the selected outcome measure for glycemic regulation, insulin sensitivity in the short term and HIP in the long term.\r\n\r\nDiscussion Population-level weight reduction interventions will be necessary to ‘turn the tide’ on HIP.

A System Dynamics Modelling Study in New South Wales, Australia','https://doi.org/10.1002/sres.2555','The persistent prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity raises significant concerns about the impact on health, society and the economy. Responding to a target announced in September 2015 by the New South Wales (Australia) Premier to reduce childhood overweight and obesity by five percentage points by 2025, a system dynamics model was developed to support Government and stakeholders responsible for meeting the target. A participatory model building process, drawing cross-sectorial expertise, was undertaken to estimate the individual and combined impact of interventions on meeting the target. The model demonstrated that it is theoretically possible to meet the target by implementing a comprehensive combination of policies and programmes. When limited to existing and enhanced population health interventions, the modelled result did not reach the target.

A sustained 50% increase in antismoking advertising exposure from 2018 reduces projected prevalence in 2037 by 0.80 percentage points. Similar reductions are projected with the introduction of tobacco wholesaler and retailer licensing schemes that either permit or prohibit tobacco sales by alcohol-licensed venues (0.65 and 1.73 percentage points, respectively). Increasing the minimum age of legal supply of tobacco products substantially reduces adolescent initiation, but has minimal impact on smoking prevalence in the adult population over the simulation period. Sustained reductions in antismoking advertising exposure of 50% and 100% from 2018 increase projected adult daily smoking prevalence in 2037 by 0.88 and 1.98 percentage points, respectively.\r\n\r\nConclusions These results suggest that any prudent approach to endgame planning should seek to build on rather than replace existing tobacco control measures that have proved effective to date.

Low rates of help-seeking, and inadequate and inequitable delivery of effective care may explain this partially, but not fully. Focusing on depressive disorders, drawing initially on ideas from the work of philosopher and socio-cultural critic Ivan Illich, we use evidence-based medicine statistics and simulation modelling approaches to develop testable hypotheses as to how iatrogenic influences on the course of depression may help explain this seeming paradox. Combined psychological treatment and antidepressant medication may be available, and beneficial, for depressed people in socioeconomically advantaged areas. But more Australians with depression live in disadvantaged areas where antidepressant medication provision without formal psychotherapy is more typical; there also are urban/non-urban disparities. Depressed people often engage in self-help strategies consistent with psychological treatments, probably often with some benefit to these people. We propose then, if people are encouraged to rely heavily on antidepressant medication only, and if they consequently reduce spontaneous self-help activity, that the benefits of the antidepressant medication may be more than offset by reductions in beneficial effects as a consequence of reduced self-help activity. While in advantaged areas, more comprehensive service delivery may result in observed prevalence lower than it would be without services, in less well-serviced areas, observed prevalence may be higher than it would otherwise be. Overall, then, we see no change. If the hypotheses receive support from the proposed research, then implications for service prioritisation and delivery could include a case for wider application of recovery-oriented practice. Critically, it would strengthen the case for action to correct inequities in the delivery of psychological treatments for depression in Australia so that combined psychological therapy and antidepressant medication, accessible and administered within an empowering framework, should be a nationally implemented standard.',NULL,NULL,'2019-06-25',NULL,NULL,NULL),(115,'“Stopping before you start”: Reducing and preventing initiation of tobacco use in the ACT','http://dx.doi.org/10.36334/modsim.2019.I2.freebairn','Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia and contributes to 5.4% of disease burden in the Australian Capital Territory. Initiation of tobacco use is most likely to occur during adolescence and young adulthood (at less than 20 years). Prevention of tobacco initiation involves a combination of regulatory, educational and health promotion interventions including restrictions on the sale of tobacco products. This paper reports on the development and use of an agent-based model to explore the impact of modifying three hypothetical regulatory and health promotion interventions: 1) increasing the minimum purchasing age for tobacco products, 2) reducing retail sales of tobacco products to persons under the minimum purchasing age and 3) reducing secondary sharing of tobacco products to persons under the minimum purchasing age using health promotion messaging. The model was built using a participatory approach that engaged policy officers, health promotion officers, epidemiologists, biostatisticians and computer scientists. The structure of the model included interacting state chart representations of smoking and level of concern about tobacco use (engagement status) and a pro-smoking score, which defined the hazard rate of initiation, cessation, and relapse. The pro-smoking score was a function of several risk factors including engagement, social effect of having more or fewer smoking peers, addiction and withdrawal levels and access to tobacco products. Parameterisation of the model drew on a range of data sources with local data being prioritised where it was available. A series of scenarios comparing the impact of the interventions on smoking prevalence rates and age of initiation are reported. Of the three interventions simulated, increasing the minimum purchasing age from 18 to 21 years had the greatest impact on smoking prevalence across the population, reducing the prevalence of smoking from 8.5% (95% CI 7.8, 9.2) to 6.9% (95% CI 6.4, 7.4) five years post-intervention and 4.1% (95% CI 3.8, 4.3) 20 years post intervention (Figure 1). The interventions aimed to reduce the sale of tobacco products to minors and reduce secondary sharing produced small reductions on their own. However, when implemented in combination with increasing the minimum purchasing age, they significantly increased the impact of this intervention from ten years post-implementation, ultimately resulting in a prevalence rate of 2.8% (95% CI 2.6, 3.0) 20 years post-implementation. Given the challenges associated with ceasing tobacco use, these in silico experiments demonstrate the importance of regulatory public health interventions to delay, and therefore potentially prevent initiation.',NULL,NULL,'2019-12-01',NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,'Static metrics of impact for a dynamic problem: The need for smarter tools to guide suicide prevention planning and investment','https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867417752866','Objectives:\r\nThis study investigates two approaches to estimate the potential impact of a population-level intervention on Australian suicide, to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate analytic approaches for informing evidence-based strategies for suicide prevention.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nThe potential impact of a psychosocial therapy intervention on the incidence of suicide in Australia over the next 10 years was used as a case study to compare the potential impact on suicides averted using: (1) a traditional epidemiological measure of population attributable risk and (2) a dynamic measure of population impact based on a systems science model of suicide that incorporates changes over time.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nBased on the population preventive fraction, findings suggest that the psychosocial therapy intervention if implemented among all eligible individuals in the Australian population would prevent 5.4% of suicides (or 1936 suicides) over the next 10 years. In comparison, estimates from the dynamic simulation model which accounts for changes in the effect size of the intervention over time, the time taken for the intervention to have an impact in the population, and likely barriers to the uptake and availability of services suggest that the intervention would avert a lower proportion of suicides (between 0.4% and 0.5%) over the same follow-up period.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nTraditional epidemiological measures used to estimate population health burden have several limitations that are often understated and can lead to unrealistic expectations of the potential impact of evidence-based interventions in real-world settings.

After suture removal, scars are susceptible to skin tension, which may be the trigger for hypertrophic scarring. Paper tape to support the scar may reduce multidirectional forces and prevent hypertrophic scarring.\r\n\r\nMethods: \r\nSeventy patients who had undergone cesarean section at the Royal Brisbane and Women\'s Hospital were randomized to treatment and control groups. Patients in the control group received no postoperative intervention. Patients in the treatment group applied paper tape to their scars for 12 weeks. Scars were assessed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery using ultrasound to measure intradermal scar volume. Scars were also assessed using the International Clinical Recommendations.\r\n\r\nResults: \r\nPaper tape significantly decreased scar volume by a mean of 0.16 cm3, (95 percent confidence interval, 0.00 to 0.29 cm3). At 12 weeks after surgery, 41 percent of the control group developed hypertrophic scars compared with none in the treatment group (exact test, p = 0.003). In the treatment group, one patient developed a hypertrophic scar and four developed stretched scars only after the tape was removed. The odds of developing a hypertrophic scar were 13.6 times greater in the control than in the treatment group (95 percent confidence interval, 3.6 to 66.9).

Our pilot case-control study presented a novel methodological approach to examining whether Facebook activity following cluster and non-cluster suicides differed. We used a scan statistic to identify suicide cluster cases occurring in spatiotemporal clusters and matched each case to 10 non-cluster control suicides. We identified the Facebook accounts of 3/48 cluster cases and 20/480 non-cluster controls and their respective friends-lists and retrieved 48 posthumous posts and replies (text segments) referring to the deceased for the former and 606 for the latter. We examined text segments for “putatively harmful” and “putatively protective” content (e.g., discussion of the suicide method vs. messages discouraging suicidal acts). We also used concept mapping, word-emotion association, and sentiment analysis and gauged user reactions to posts using the reactions-to-posts ratio. We found no “putatively harmful” or “putatively protective” content following any suicides. However, “family” and “son” concepts were more common for cluster cases and “xx”, “sorry” and “loss” concepts were more common for non-cluster controls, and there were twice as many surprise- and disgust-associated words for cluster cases. Posts pertaining to non-cluster controls were four times as receptive as those about cluster cases. We hope that the approach we have presented may help to guide future research to explain suicide clusters and social-media contagion.',NULL,NULL,'2021-12-19',NULL,NULL,NULL);
