He is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia and Co-Director, Health and Policy, of the Brain & Mind Centre (BMC), University of Sydney. From 2012 to 2018, he was a Commissioner of the Australian National Mental Health Commission (NMHC), with a major focus on improving outcome measurement and improved accountability for Australia’s investments in mental health services. In partnership with the Mental Health Council of Australia, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, Orygen Youth Health, the Young & Well CRC and the National Mental Health Commission, he has authored major national reports on community experiences of mental health services. Prof Hickie was a key participant in the most recent 2014 NMHC review of Mental Health Programmes and Services, which served as the template for the 2015 Turnbull Government initiatives in Mental Health Reform (total value $190M), including specifically the $30M Project Synergy investment in new technologies and the new $90M investment in 12 large regional trials of suicide prevention. His long-standing commitment to the impact of mental health research on mental health service improvement, through active engagement with those with lived experiences (patients, families and communities) in Australia is evident in his: i) capacity to facilitate public engagement with mental health issues, notably through his initial CEO role with beyondblue (2000-03); ii) engagement with major national mental health service reports over two decades (notably 2006, Not For Service Report with Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission); iii) continuous public commentary on contemporary mental health and suicide prevention issues; and iv) role in implementation of substantive health services reform in Australia (e.g. headspace and Young&Well CRC and now Project Synergy). He has been recognised nationally for his role over the last two decades in using clinical, health services and population health data to drive enhanced primary care services, increased access to psychological treatments and better interventions for those with severe mood disorders. In partnership with Prof Pat McGorry, he has been at the forefront of development and systematic evaluation of the new primary care based national youth mental health services (headspace). He has been a critical voice in the advocacy for enhanced social and health services for those with persistent mental illness and increased accountability for delivery of those services.'),(47,'Danya

The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to effectively respond.                             Objective           This study aimed to explore the impact of strengthening the mental health system through technology-enabled care coordination on mental health and suicide outcomes.                             Methods           A system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behavior. The model reproduced historic time series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental healthÂ–related emergency department (ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030. These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care coordination. Each scenario was tested using both preÂ– and postÂ–COVID-19 social and economic conditions.

The same approach is possible in the field of mental health. However, a commonly levelled (but misguided) criticism prevents systems modelling from being more routinely adopted, namely, that the presence of uncertainty around key model input parameters renders a model useless. This study explored whether radically different simulated trajectories of suicide would result in different advice to decision makers regarding the optimal strategy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. Using an existing system dynamics model developed in August 2020 for a regional catchment of Western Australia, four scenarios were simulated to model the possible effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of psychological distress. The scenarios produced a range of projected impacts on suicide deaths, ranging from a relatively small to a dramatic increase. Discordance in the sets of best-performing intervention scenarios across the divergent COVID-mental health trajectories was assessed by comparing differences in projected numbers of suicides between the baseline scenario and each of 286 possible intervention scenarios calculated for two time horizons; 2026 and 2041.

As the trajectory of the pandemic and the economic recovery are still uncertain, decision tools are needed to help evaluate the best interventions to improve mental health outcomes. We developed a system dynamics model that captures causal relationships among population, demographics, post-secondary education, health services, COVID-19 impact, and mental health outcomes. The study was conducted in the Australian state of Victoria. The model was calibrated using historical data and was stratified by age group and by geographic remoteness. Findings demonstrate that the most effective intervention combination includes economic, social, and health sector initiatives. Assertive post-suicide attempt care is the most impactful health sector intervention, but delaying implementation reduces the potency of its impact.

Scenarios comparing population-level and targeted prevention interventions were simulated from 2018 to identify the intervention combination that would deliver the greatest impact.\r\n\r\nResults Population interventions promoting weight loss in early adulthood were found to be effective, reducing the population incidence of HIP by 17.3% by 2030 (baseline (‘business as usual’ scenario)=16.1%, 95% CI 15.8 to 16.4; population intervention=13.3%, 95% CI 13.0 to 13.6), more than targeted prepregnancy (5.2% reduction; incidence=15.3%, 95% CI 15.0 to 15.6) and interpregnancy (4.2% reduction; incidence=15.5%, 95% CI 15.2 to 15.8) interventions. Combining targeted interventions for high-risk groups with population interventions promoting healthy weight was most effective in reducing HIP incidence (28.8% reduction by 2030; incidence=11.5, 95% CI 11.2 to 11.8). Scenarios exploring the effect of childhood weight status on entry to adulthood demonstrated significant impact in the selected outcome measure for glycemic regulation, insulin sensitivity in the short term and HIP in the long term.\r\n\r\nDiscussion Population-level weight reduction interventions will be necessary to ‘turn the tide’ on HIP. Weight reduction interventions targeting high-risk individuals, while beneficial for those individuals, did not significantly impact forecasted HIP incidence rates.

Although familiarity with technology and digital literacy are increasing among this group, some older adults still lack confidence in their ability to use web-based technologies. In addition, age-related changes in cognition, vision, hearing, and perception may be barriers to adoption and highlight the need for digital tools developed specifically to meet the unique needs of older adults.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThe aim of this study is to understand the use of technology by older adults in general and identify the potential barriers to and facilitators of the adoption of health information technologies (HITs) to support the health and well-being of older adults to facilitate implementation and promote user uptake. In addition, this study aims to co-design and configure the InnoWell Platform, a digital tool designed to facilitate better outcomes for people seeking mental health services, to meet the needs of adults 50 years and older and their supportive others (eg, family members, caregivers) to ensure the accessibility, engagement, and appropriateness of the technology.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nParticipants were adults 50 years and older and those who self-identified as a supportive other (eg, family member, caregiver). Participants were invited to participate in a 3-hour participatory design workshop using a variety of methods, including prompted discussion, creation of descriptive artifacts, and group-based development of user journeys.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nFour participatory design workshops were conducted, including a total of 21 participants, each attending a single workshop. Technology use was prevalent, with a preference indicated for smartphones and computers. Factors facilitating the adoption of HITs included personalization of content and functionality to meet and be responsive to a consumer’s needs, access to up-to-date information from reputable sources, and integration with standard care practices to support the relationship with health professionals. Concerns regarding data privacy and security were the primary barriers to the use of technology to support mental health and well-being.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nAlthough HITs have the potential to improve access to cost-effective and low-intensity interventions at scale for improving and maintaining mental health and well-being, several strategies may improve the uptake and efficacy of technologies by the older adult community, including the use of co-design methodologies to ensure usability, acceptability, and appropriateness of the technology; support in using and understanding the clinical applications of the technology by a digital navigator; and ready availability of education and training materials.',0000,NULL,NULL,'2021-06-01',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(287,'The chronic fatigue syndrome: a comprehensive approach to its definition and study','https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-121-12-199412150-00009','\nThe complexities of the chronic fatigue syndrome and the methodologic problems associated with its study indicate the need for a comprehensive, systematic, and integrated approach to the evaluation, classification, and study of persons with this condition and other fatiguing illnesses.

The number of logins was the most commonly reported measure of adherence, followed by the number of modules completed. The heterogeneity of adherence and outcome measures limited analysis. However, logins appeared to be the measure of adherence most consistently related to outcomes in physical health interventions, while module completion was found to be most related to outcomes in psychological health interventions.\nConclusions: There is large variation in the reporting of adherence and the association of adherence with outcomes.

We contend it represents the best value for money for new investment in the mental health arena. Services for young people affected by mental health and related substance use disorders tend to be threadbare and split across multiple levels of government, multiple program areas, and myriad cash-strapped service providers. In addition, spending in the area remains poor, and service access and tenure are actively withheld in most specialist mental health and substance misuse service systems until high levels of risk or danger are reached, or severe illness, sustained disability and chronicity are entrenched. While primary care services encounter many young people with mental disorders, the detection and treatment rates are extremely low and poorly supported by specialist services. 23, 24 The consequences of this structural weakness in both primary care and specialist services, as well as the under-resourcing and poor coordination, are enormous. Just when mental health services are most needed by young people and their families, they are often inaccessible or unacceptable in design, style and quality. Numerous young people with distressing and disabling mental health difficulties struggle to find age-appropriate assistance (see Rickwood et al, page S35 and Hickie et al, page S47).

These include brevity, low cost (preferably being in the public domain), self-report rather than clinician-administered format, results that are readily communicated to the patient, and demonstrated responsiveness to change in clinical status. Further, symptom-based instruments should be focused on the common symptoms of depression, anxiety or related somatic constructs. 9 Such instruments also lend themselves to automation and electronic record keeping. While illness-specific measures are commonly used in specialist practice (eg, for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder only), they are far less attractive in general medical settings. Given these considerations, we recommend a small series of instruments for use in general medical settings.

The deficits described have primarily involved the do-mains of attention, concentration and motor speed (the so-called\" sub-cortical” tasks). Various aspects of memory and planning have also been noted to be affected, though the nature of such impairments has often been described in non-uniform terms, reflecting the specific cog-nitive paradigm under investigation. In the interpretation of memory impairment, emphasis continues to be placed on the possible roles of effort, motivation and attention to the task, all of which are impaired in depressed patients. However, memory deficits that do not reflect such factors are probably a feature of most depressive disorders (Austin et al. 1992b). Aphasias and apraxias (cortical tasks), have not generally been associated with depressive disorders and, when present, have typ-ically been considered as positive evidence of an underlying dementing disorder.\nDifferential patterns of neurocognitive impairment may be evident in less severe forms of depression (ie, greatest impairment in subcortical rather than cortical tasks).

Objective This proof of concept open-label study sought to determine if improvements in depressive symptoms following an adjunctive multimodal intervention including agomelatine intake are associated with the magnitude of circadian realignment. This was investigated in young people with depression, a subgroup known to have high rates of delayed circadian rhythms. Methods Young people with depression received a psychoeducation session about sleep and circadian rhythms, were asked to progressively phase advance their wake up time, and completed an 8-week course of agomelatine (25-50 mg). Participants underwent semi-structured psychological assessments, ambulatory sleep-wake monitoring and measurement of melatonin circadian phase before and after the intervention. Results Twenty-four young adults with depression (17-28 years old; 58% females) completed the study.

Fifty-three young adults (age range 15–33 years, mean=21.8, sd=4.3) with emerging affective disorders were recruited from a specialized tertiary referral service.

Mental disorders have early ages of onset, syndromal complexity and high individual variability in course and response to treatment. As most locally-delivered health systems do not account for this complexity in their design, implementation, scale or evaluation they often result in disappointing impacts. In this viewpoint, we contend that the absence of an appropriate predictive planning framework is one critical reason that countries fail to make substantial progress in mental health outcomes. Addressing this missing infrastructure is vital to guide and coordinate national and regional (local) investments, to ensure limited mental health resources are put to best use, and to strengthen health systems to achieve the mental health targets of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Most broad national policies over-emphasize provision of single elements of care (e.g. medicines, individual psychological therapies) and assess their population-level impact through static, linear and program logic-based evaluation. More sophisticated decision analytic approaches that can account for complexity have long been successfully used in non-health sectors and are now emerging in mental health research and practice. We argue that utilization of advanced decision support tools such as systems modelling and simulation, is now required to bring a necessary discipline to new national and local investments in transforming mental health systems.

This chapter outlines a transdiagnostic framework for classifying common adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, combining two independent but complementary dimensions: clinical staging, and three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical staging reflects the progression of mental disorders and is in line with the concept used in general medicine, where more advanced stages are associated with a poorer prognosis and a need for more intensive interventions with a higher risk-to-benefit ratio. The three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms are neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hyperarousal and circadian dysfunction, which, over time, have illness trajectories (or pathways) to psychosis, anxious depression and bipolar spectrum disorders, respectively.

Despite these diYculties, the most striking feature of many of these disorders in medical settings is their impact on patterns of health care utilization and doctor–patient interactions (Clements, Sharpe, Simkin, Borrill & Hawton, 1997; Gureje, Simon, Ustun & Goldberg, 1997; Kroenke et al., 1997).

Predicting self-harm is challenging due to their rarity and complexity, however this does not preclude the utility of prediction models to improve decision-making regarding a service response in terms of more detailed assessments and/or intervention. The aim of this study was to predict self-harm within six-months after initial presentation.   Method The study included 1962 young people (12Â–30 years) presenting to youth mental health services in Australia. Six machine learning algorithms were trained and tested with ten repeats of ten-fold cross-validation. The net benefit of these models were evaluated using decision curve analysis.   Results Out of 1962 young people, 320 (16%) engaged in self-harm in the six months after first assessment and 1642 (84%) did not. The top 25% of young people as ranked by mean predicted probability accounted for 51.6% - 56.2% of all who engaged in self-harm. By the top 50%, this increased to 82.1%-84.4%.

The Australian Genetics of Depression study was established to recruit a large cohort of individuals who have been diagnosed with depression, and to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors for depression and response to commonly prescribed antidepressants.

Frequent or episodic binge drinking (consuming five or more standard drinks on a single occasion) is of specific concern among youth because of their neurobiological vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. There is increasing evidence that key aspects of brain and related neurocognitive development continue into early adulthood. Available evidence associates short-and longer-term cognitive impairment during the postpubertal and early adult years with an earlier age-of-onset of harmful alcohol consumption. 1 Although ethical limitations preclude human experimental trials, there is emerging neuropsychological and brain-imaging evidence associating binge drinking or persistent high levels of alcohol use with adverse impacts on brain development (notably of the frontal lobe and frontal–striatal circuits) in young people. 1 The ways in which such harms may accumulate are increasingly considered within a developmental framework that seeks to identify pathways to alcohol-induced brain impairment. 1 This pathway-based approach emphasises the potential benefits that may result from earlier modification of patterns of excessive alcohol use. A delay in the age of exposure to the toxic effects of alcohol may be of particular benefit to those who are vulnerable due to neurodevelopmental delays. 1 The need to introduce effective alcohol control policies targeting the youth population is indicated by recent increases in alcohol-attributable hospitalisations and emergency department attendances.

However, limited information is available on how FA deficiencies relate to psychopathology in individuals with UHR phenotypes. Here, we report the relationship between membrane FA levels and symptom severity in a study of individuals at UHR for psychosis. Methods: Data from 280 of 304 (92%) of participants of the NEURAPRO study, a multi-centre randomized-controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo, were used for the present analysis. All participants were aged between 13 and 40 years and met criteria for UHR for psychosis. Blood samples were collected at study baseline and month 6 (end-of-intervention).

The main contribution of this paper is to show that the subjective choice of data and analysis methodology substantially impacts the identification of factors and outcomes of observational studies. This subjective variability of inference is at the heart of recent discussions around irreproducibility in scientific research. To demonstrate this subjective variability, data is taken from an existing study, where interest centres on understanding the factors associated with a young adult\'s propensity to fall into the category of `not in employment, education or training\' (NEET). A fully probabilistic analysis is performed, set in a Bayesian framework and implemented using Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). The results show that different techniques lead to different inference but that models consisting of different factors often have the same predictive performance, whether the analysis is frequentist or Bayesian, making inference problematic.

Unfortunately, these concurrent sleep problems can have profound effects on the disease course. Although the full biology of sleep remains to be elucidated, a recent genome-wide association (GWAS) of insomnia, and other sleep traits in over 1 million individuals was recently published and provides many promising hits for genetics of insomnia in a population-based sample. \nMethods: Using data from the largest available GWAS of insomnia and other sleep traits, we sought to test if sleep variable PRS scores derived from population-based studies predicted sleep variables in samples of depressed cases [Psychiatric Genomics Consortium - Major Depressive Disorder subjects (PGC MDD)]. A leave-one-out analysis was performed to determine the effects that each individual study had on our results. \nResults: The only significant finding was for insomnia, where p-value threshold, p = 0.05 was associated with insomnia in our PGC MDD sample (R2 = 1.75-3, p = 0.006). \nConclusion: Our results reveal that <1% of variance is explained by the variants that cover the two significant p-value thresholds, which is in line with the fact that depression and insomnia are both polygenic disorders.

By facilitating better communication and coordination within and between youth mental health services, the goal is to guide young people quickly to the level of care they need and reduce instances of those receiving inappropriate care (too much or too little), or no care at all. Yet, it is often unclear how this goal can be achieved in a scalable way in local regions. We recommend using technology-enabled care coordination to facilitate streamlined transitions for young people across primary, secondary, more specialised or hospital-based care. First, we describe how technology-enabled care coordination could be achieved through two fundamental shifts in current service provisions; a model of care which puts the person at the centre of their care; and a technology infrastructure that facilitates this model. Second, we detail how dynamic simulation modelling can be used to rapidly test the operational features of implementation and the likely impacts of technology-enabled care coordination in a local service environment. Combined with traditional implementation research, dynamic simulation modelling can facilitate the transformation of real-world services.

This study investigates differences between participants who donated a saliva sample or agreed to linkage of their records compared to those who did not. We observed that older, male participants with a higher education were more likely to donate a saliva sample. Self-reported bipolar disorder, ADHD, panic disorder, PTSD, substance use disorder and social anxiety disorder were associated with lower odds of donating a saliva sample whereas anorexia was associated with higher odds of donation. Male and younger participants showed higher odds of agreeing to record linkage. Participants with higher neuroticism scores and those with a history of bipolar disorder were also more likely to agree to record linkage whereas participants with a diagnosis of anorexia were less likely to agree. Increased likelihood of consent was also associated with increased genetic susceptibility to anorexia and reduced genetic risk for depression, and schizophrenia whereas there was no significant genetic effect for neuroticism.

At a fundamental level, it necessitates appreciating the influence of both inherited and acquired factors on brain specialization and the setting of trajectories during periods of plasticity and risk, all of which delineate adult trajectories in multiple dimensions. More pragmatically, it requires us to track a range of salient mental/physiological systems during a dynamic developmental period that includes both vulnerability and risk, to contemplate their utility in identifying enriched groups that might benefit from further individual-level assessment in clinical or community settings, and to translate findings into planning prevention and intervention programs and to informing clinical decision making.',2022,NULL,NULL,'2020-04-14',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','Youth Mental Health: A Paradigm for Prevention and Early Intervention','28','','31','MIT Press'),(1452,'Nick Martin and the Genetics of Depression: Sample Size, Sample Size, Sample Size','https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/nick-martin-and-the-genetics-of-depression-sample-size-sample-size-sample-size/B8ECA6926DE980CCCC0052E73ABA3670','Nick Martin is a pioneer in recognizing the need for large sample size to study the complex, heterogeneous and polygenic disorders of common mental disorders.

The identification of such “stageÂ” dependant markers may be more meaningful and of greater prognostic and therapeutic value than our quest for categorical disease markers.

Methods:\n Data collection is ongoing for this study and full results will be available for presentation in mid-2017. However, data to-date has been collected on 15 individuals\' at risk\'for dementia, that is, presenting with subjective cognitive complaints and/or mild cognitive impairment. All participants were recruited from the Healthy Brain Ageing Clinic at University of Sydney, and underwent comprehensive psychiatric, medical, neuropsychological assessment and an MRI scan where 1H-MRS data in the ACC was obtained. GSH data was reported as a ratio to creatine (Cr) to facilitate comparison between subjects and across time points.

They also raise some concerns and provide additional interpretations of our results. Malhi et al. suggest that we should better exploit this vast data set to study the heterogeneity of MDD. MDD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the scope and extent of brain alterations depends on specific clinical characteristics of the sample studied. That is why we reported meta-analytic results of subcortical volume differences in depressed patients stratified by stage of illness (first episode versus recurrent) and age of onset (early versus late). 3 Compared to controls, hippocampal volume was lower in recurrent and early-onset patients, on an average, but not in first-episode patients or patients diagnosed after age 21. These findings indeed raise interesting questions: for instance, whether hippocampal volume reductions are detectable in earlyonset first-episode patients. Malhi et al. suggest partitioning our sample into finer subgroups to study these interactions. We agree that it is important to analyze between-subject differences across these complex interactions, but our study design did not allow for delineating these more complex interactions (for example, diagnosis x recurrence x age of onset). Our meta-analysis comprised standardized processing, statistics and quality control to harmonize methods in a sample of unprecedented size.

Key factors that are associated with disability and these disorders in young people are social and economic participation (eg education, employment), physical health, suicide and self-harm behaviours, and alcohol and substance use. A better understanding of the objective markers (ie neurobiological parameters) associated with these factors is important for the development of effective early interventions that reduce the impact of disability and illness persistence. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature for neurobiological parameters (ie neuropsychology, neuroimaging, sleep-wake and circadian biology, neurophysiology and metabolic measures) associated with functional domains in young people (12 to 30 years) with mood and/or anxiety disorders. Results: Of the one hundred and thirty-four studies selected, 7.6% investigated social and economic participation, 2. 1% physical health, 15.3% suicide and self-harm behaviours, 6.9% alcohol and substance use, whereas the majority (68.1%) focussed on clinical syndrome.\nConclusions: Despite the predominance of studies that solely examine the clinical syndrome of young people the literature also provides evidence of distinct associations among objective measures (indexing various aspects of brain circuitry) and other functional domains.

Internet e-health applications have been found to be successful in reducing symptoms of anxiety and stress for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, social phobia and depression. However, to date, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of e-health applications in adult GAD. There are no studies which have directly compared e-health applications with recognised evidence-based medication. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a web-based program for treating GAD relative to sertraline and attention placebo. Methods/Design: 120 community-dwelling participants, aged 18-30 years with a clinical diagnosis of GAD will be recruited from the Australian Electoral Roll.

To support participants in screening and management of depression, the Cardiac Depression Collaborative Australia (CDCA) was established in 2009.\nAim: To assess the impact of the CDCA on screening rates for depression in cardiac rehabilitation (CR).\nMethod: In 2009, 10 teams across NSW enrolled in the first phase of the CDCA program. The CDCA uses the collaborative methodology to bring together teams to share experiences and develop their knowledge and skills. As part of the CDCA teams have developed policies and procedures for screening for depression in CR using the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ2+) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).\nResults: To date 807 individuals have been screened from July 2009 to January 2010.

Australians also had little knowledge about depression (prevalence rates, signs and symptoms) its effective treatments (pharmacological and psychological). There was also limited knowledge regarding behaviours that need to be implemented to obtain effective treatment in the community. Australians also held negative attitudes towards people who experience depression and its treatments.\nMethodology: One year on from this initial baseline study, the survey has been repeated (and extended) in October 2002 with an increased sample of 2000 respondents across the Australia.\nResults: In addition to evaluating the extent\n',2003,NULL,NULL,'2003-10-01',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','37','','A15-A15','BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA'),(1683,'Exploring the perspectives of people whose lives have been affected by depression, and the implications for beyondblue developments','https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8433121842407788302&hl=en&oi=scholarr','',2003,NULL,NULL,'2003-10-01',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','37','','A19-A19','BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA'),(1684,'Determining relationships between psychological and somatic distress in older general practice attenders','https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9524422984550660148&hl=en&oi=scholarr','',2003,NULL,NULL,'2003-10-01',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','37','','A15-A16','BLACKWELL PUBLISHING ASIA'),(1685,'Structured problem solving in general practice','https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.375852331053307','This is the third article in the series on psychological treatments in general practice.

Mice deficient in gephyrin develop a hereditary molybdenum cofactor deficiency and a neurological phenotype that mimics startle disease (hyperekplexia). This neuromotor disorder is associated with mutations in the GlyR alpha1 and beta subunit genes (GLRA1 and GLRB). Further genetic heterogeneity is suspected, and we hypothesized that patients lacking mutations in GLRA1 and GLRB might have mutations in the gephyrin gene (GPHN). In addition, we adopted a yeast two-hybrid screen, using the GlyR beta subunit intracellular loop as bait, in an attempt to identify further GlyR-interacting proteins implicated in hyperekplexia.
